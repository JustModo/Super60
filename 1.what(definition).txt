Data Modelling

ER - Entity Relationship
Master data- repeatable standard data
Transactional data - it specific and cannot be modified 
depending on the scenario we can have 1-1, 1-many or many to many relationship
minimum and maximum cardinality

when we have 1-1 relationship we can have the data in the same table or different table
in case of 1-many we should have the primary key of one table in many tables
in case of many-many we should include the primary keys of two tables in a third table
